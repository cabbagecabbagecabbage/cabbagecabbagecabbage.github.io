# Introductions

Hello there, thanks for visiting!

I'm Rayton, a 17-year-old high school student from Canada. I enjoy programming, watching videos, chatting with friends, and listening to music. You can read more about me on <a href="https://dulcet-pastelito-8ae32b.netlify.app/" target="_blank">my main website</a>.


# Why I'm starting a blog

Here are some things I hope to achieve through blogging:
- develop and organize my ideas and thereby improve my ability to articulate them
- reflect on and reassess different elements of my psyche
- document my experiences and opinions as I mature
- share my knowledge and thoughts with anyone interested (e.g. my future self, maybe)


# What I'm not aiming for

Unlike some other blogs, here are some things I will **not necessarily** aim to do:
- promote my blog publicly or attract traffic
- appeal to one specific audience/limit myself to writing about one topic
- deliberately make my posts entertaining to anyone except myself
- maintain a consistent posting schedule


# Contact

Feel free to reach out to me through Discord or Email! Especially if you have any questions or discover formatting/spelling/grammar mistakes (I'm somewhat pedantic about this stuff :P).
