## Introductions

Hello there, thanks for visiting!

I'm Rayton, a 17-year-old high school student from Canada. I enjoy programming, watching TV-shows, chatting with friends, and listening to music. You can read more about me on <a href="https://dulcet-pastelito-8ae32b.netlify.app/" target="_blank">my main website</a>.


## Why I'm starting a blog

- to force myself to think more deeply about my psyche (values, conduct, etc.) 
- to develop and organize my ideas, and thereby improve my ability to articulate them
- to document my experiences and opinions as I mature
- to share my knowledge and thoughts with anyone interested (e.g. my future self, maybe)


## What I'm not necessarily aiming to do

- promote my blog or attract traffic
- appeal to a specific audience
- entertain my readers
- force myself to post once every X days
