# Introductions

Hello there, thanks for visiting!

I'm Rayton, a 17-year-old high school student from Canada. I enjoy programming, watching videos, chatting with friends, and listening to music. You can read more about me on <a href="https://dulcet-pastelito-8ae32b.netlify.app/" target="_blank">my main website</a>.


# Why I'm starting a blog

Here are some things I hope to achieve through blogging:
- develop and organize my ideas and thereby improve my ability to articulate them
- reflect on and reassess different elements of my psyche (values, conduct, etc.) 
- document my experiences and opinions as I mature
- share my knowledge and thoughts with anyone interested (e.g. my future self, maybe)


# What I'm not necessarily aiming to do

Unlike some other blogs, here are some things I don't really care about:
- promoting my blog publicly or attracting traffic
- appealing to a specific audience
- entertaining readers
- maintaining a consistent posting schedule


# Contact

Feel free to reach out to me through Discord or Email! Especially if you have any questions or discover formatting/spelling/grammar mistakes (I'm somewhat pedantic about this stuff :P).
