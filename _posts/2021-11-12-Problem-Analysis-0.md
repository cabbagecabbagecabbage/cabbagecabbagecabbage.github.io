# Note 

This series of six blog posts was originally a submission to the EWC4U course. Shout-out to Ms. D for allowing me to write about such a technical topic for this unit!

I'll make a few edits here and there, but I'll mostly just be migrating the six posts over as-is. I might continue this series one day if I stumble upon a particularly elegant problem.


# Introduction

Hello there. I'm a high school student who enjoys mathematical and algorithmic problem-solving. At the time of writing, I have about a year of experience in competitive programming, a mind-sport where contestants solve programming tasks as quickly as possible under certain constraints. 

Among all of the programming problems I solved last year, I found several to be particularly creative and educational. I hope to share some of the ideas in these problems with other problem-solving enthusiasts. In this series of blog posts, I will present the solutions to six problems of varying topics in order of increasing difficulty.

I often get stuck on problems and read the problem editorials. An issue with many problem editorials is the lack of detail and explanation for the motivation needed to formulate the correct solution. I aim to provide a comprehensive exposition of the solutions to these problems by avoiding leaps in logic, presenting proofs for non-trivial claims, providing links to external resources, and navigating through multi-step solutions in an intuitive manner.

This is not to say that no prerequisite experience in algorithmic problem solving is required to understand the analyses. Instead, I aim to educate/interest readers who are capable of making a decent attempt at the problems themselves and are willing to put in some effort to understand the problems and their solutions.

I encourage readers to attempt the problems before reading the analyses. If the titles seem somewhat dull, that's because I don't want to spoil anything about the solution beforehand.


Feel free to contact me if you have any questions, comments, or corrections. Have fun problem-solving!
