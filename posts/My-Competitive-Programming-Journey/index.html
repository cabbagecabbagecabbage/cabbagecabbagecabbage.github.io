I’ll be skipping over the technical details of my training and less significant contest results (Google Kickstart, Codeforces rounds, DMOJ contests, etc.).</p><h2 id="before-it-all-started"><span class="mr-2">Before It All Started…</span><a href="#before-it-all-started" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>The answer to “When did you start learning competitive programming?” would technically be Grade 8. I attended an after-school program, CodeReach, which introduced me to various concepts in computer science, including simple algorithms. Of course, the problems I encountered were quite elementary (mostly loops and conditionals). I do remember learning some graph theory, but I didn’t understand it very well at the time.</p><p>In Grade 9, I started high school and attended the computer science club. Traditionally, the computer science club has always focused on preparing for the Canadian Computing Competition. The concepts and problems I encountered here were much more in the spirit of competitive programming. I learned simple data structures like prefix sum arrays and simple algorithms such as Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search. However, I still wouldn’t count these 2 years towards competitive programming experience because I was not very committed to it yet.</p><p>It should be noted that I scored 73/75 on the Junior CCC that year because that was perhaps the moment I realized that I had some potential to excel in competitive programming. Unfortunately, I pushed aside any desire to be productive during the summer. An event earlier in the year led me to develop a tendency to indulge in entertainment with little restraint as a form of escapism. Regrettably, the summer passed without me doing anything particularly meaningful.</p><h2 id="start-of-my-journey"><span class="mr-2">Start of My Journey</span><a href="#start-of-my-journey" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Near the start of the school year, I was scrolling through the computer science club Discord server where I found out that some of the seniors (namely, S, G, and L) spent much of their summer working on competitive programming problems. I felt terrible about myself – I let my summer waste away while others worked hard to put themselves ahead. On September 14th, I decided to start devoting almost all my free time to competitive programming training. I recognize this as the proper beginning of my competitive programming journey.</p><p>Trying to solve problems was extremely strenuous and time-consuming at first. A hard problem could take me more than 6 hours because of my lack of resources, assistance, and experience (not just with competitive programming but with coding in general). As a side note, this is why I try my best to provide the club members with learning resources and answer their help requests as promptly as possible now that I’m one of the teachers. I understand and sympathize with the frustration that comes with problem-solving, especially in the early stages of training.</p><p>Despite my struggles, I committed myself to solve one problem every day. I documented my progress on my DMOJ profile, which kept me motivated throughout the year. Of course, some problems took me more than one day to solve, and sometimes I solved more than one problem. Regardless of whether it was followed strictly, the rule I imposed on myself made me much more productive.</p><p>As the year went on, I found online resources and communities that made the grind a lot less frustrating. My improvement was noticeable: after a few months, I was competing with the seniors for first and second place in the computer science club contests, even though they had much more experience than me. There was an invaluable feedback loop occurring: the more I practiced, the more improvement I noticed; the more improvement I noticed, the more motivated I was to practice. I can only hope to replicate this cycle in every pursuit of expertise.</p><h2 id="ccc-2021"><span class="mr-2">CCC 2021</span><a href="#ccc-2021" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Six months (and around 300 problems solved) after I started my competitive programming journey, the Canadian Computing Competition took place. CCC 2021 was one of the “luckiest” performances of my contest career.</p><ul><li>S2 was almost identical to a problem I had done a few days before the contest. I finished the first 2 problems within 10 minutes of the 3-hour window.<li>S3 was a problem I had never encountered before. I was very lucky to solve it because I was only able to observe that the values resembled a discrete unimodal function after I instinctively printed out all the brute-forced values. I solved this problem by deriving the ternary search algorithm on my own (I had never seen the algorithm before), which I’m not sure I could do if I were put in that spot again.<li>I was able to salvage 7 partial points from S4. The subtask only involved unweighted SSSP – a problem I had done many times in my practice.</ul><p><img data-src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/776252217270992906/995004301128765480/unknown.png" alt="CCC Club Scoreboard" data-proofer-ignore></p><p>I scored 55/75 points in the end, which put me first on the scoreboard of the club. While I celebrated my relatively successful performance, I made sure that I did not relax: I immediately resumed my competitive programming training the same night the CCC took place.</p><p><img data-src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/776252217270992906/993208128185311242/unknown.png" alt="submissions on Feb 19th" data-proofer-ignore></p><h2 id="ecoo-2021"><span class="mr-2">ECOO 2021</span><a href="#ecoo-2021" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Three months later, the ECOO Programming Contest took place. ECOO was traditionally a team contest where you collaborate with a few other programmers to solve problems. However, COVID forced everything (in 2021) to be online, so it was held as an individual contest instead.</p><p>Placing 12th in the province is undoubtedly my most perplexing achievement, considering that I can easily name 20 Toronto kids (or, at least, their DMOJ handles) who would destroy me in their sleep under normal circumstances. I must suspect that there were some technical difficulties with the judge that impeded others’ progress.</p><p>Below is a screenshot of me being 4th on the scoreboard at one point, taken out of disbelief.</p><p><img data-src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/715675201831960585/838080602036109442/unknown.png" alt="ECOO scoreboard at some point" data-proofer-ignore> <em>It’s funny that, after lurking in the DMOJ community for a while, I can almost tell who these people are just by their school names.

I still practiced a lot, but my improvement slowed down. I am inclined to attribute this to the law of diminishing returns: the better you are at something, the harder it is to improve significantly.</p><p>While lurking the DMOJ Discord server, I discovered that <a href="https://dmoj.ca/user/xiaowuc1">an experienced competitive programmer</a> was curating <a href="https://amolina.ca/bojlist/camp-vert">a set of problems for CCC training</a>. I encountered many educational and elegant problems as I worked through the set throughout the summer. One of my proudest solves from this problem set is <a href="https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/14749">Grasshopper Route</a>. It took me several days of intermittent attempts to solve, but in the end, I came up with (as far as I know) a unique solution on my own.</p><p>However, in hindsight, I don’t think it was entirely productive for me to attempt these problems. The reason is very simple: the majority of these problems are way too difficult for me. That was something I refused to admit, despite me requiring assistance on more than half of the problems I invested hours into. To be clear, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with the problem set itself - this is probably a great resource for people who can legitimately solve these problems in a contest setting.</p><p>There’s no doubt that my problem-solving skills improved by attempting these problems, but since I wasn’t practicing problems of appropriate difficulty in a contest setting, I don’t think it effectively translated to more successful contest performances despite the effort I invested.</p><h2 id="ccc-2022"><span class="mr-2">CCC 2022</span><a href="#ccc-2022" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>I did not practice as much in the 2022 school year for a couple of reasons; it took me many hours to prepare lessons for the senior stream every week and come up with/find problems to put on the contests, aside from a busier workload from school. I still tried to find time to do some problems here and there, but I didn’t actively participate in online contests.</p><p>With these petty excuses out of the way, CCC 2022 was an absolute nightmare for me - it depresses me to recollect the experience. Nevertheless, here’s roughly what happened (if memory serves):</p><ul><li>After misreading both S1 and S2, I solved them in 15 minutes.<li>I read and attempted to understand S3, S4, and S5. This took me another 15 minutes.<li>I worked on S3 by drawing out sample cases on paper. I made several useful observations, such as the construction for the maximum value and how the construction can be manipulated to reduce the value to the desired value. I had a rough idea of what the solution would look like around the 1h30 mark.<li>I became extremely confused by edge cases and implementation bugs (something about subtracting iterators not giving me the proper index, but I can’t remember exactly what the bug was). My code (and my mental state) quickly became an absolute mess.<li>Panic was through the roof by the 2h mark. I decided to leave S3 aside temporarily and instead start doing damage control by going for S4 partials. Again, I can’t recall what happened, but I kept running into bugs that I’d never seen before.<li>In summary, I spent the last hour switching between working on S3 full and S4 partials. By the end, I had no idea what I was doing anymore. I had 3 different versions of my S3 solution (none of which worked), each one a complete mess that I eventually no longer understood.<li>With a few minutes left, it occurred to me that I should at least get some partials for S3. My time ran out as I was coding up the second subtask.</ul><p>I ended with a laughable score of 33/75. I say laughable not because anyone made fun of it, but because I can’t mentally accept it after coming off of a rather successful year in 2021. Of course, 33 is not objectively a “bad” score considering the certificate cutoff is 30, but after hundreds of hours of training, it devastates me to end with a score that I could’ve achieved in 30 minutes with no prior training whatsoever.</p><p>I vividly recall staring at the wall and being completely paralyzed for around 10 minutes after the contest, overwhelmed with disbelief, shame, and dejection.</p><h2 id="a-final-breath"><span class="mr-2">A Final Breath</span><a href="#a-final-breath" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>It would be quite tragic if CCC 2022 was the last memorable contest of my journey. Thankfully, just before I retired, I successfully advanced to the Gold division of USACO in the 2022 US Open contest. I haven’t talked about USACO at all yet because I was stuck in the Silver division for 2 years; I advanced to Silver during my first contest and remained there for around 6 contests.</p><p>For context, the US Open is usually the hardest contest of the season, so I didn’t expect to do well at all. Nevertheless, I took the contest one problem at a time, and before I knew it, I solved all the problems with 3 hours to spare in the 5-hour window. This performance was a much-needed suggestion that perhaps I was not as worthless as CCC 2022 exposed me to be.</p><p><img data-src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/776252217270992906/957759406827778058/unknown.png" alt="Promoting to Gold" data-proofer-ignore></p><h2 id="my-future-involvement-in-competitive-programming"><span class="mr-2">My Future Involvement in Competitive Programming</span><a href="#my-future-involvement-in-competitive-programming" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>As the contest organizer for next year’s computer science club, I’m clearly not fully detached from competitive programming yet. I don’t mind it though - setting problems for contests is something I enjoy, which is why I switched roles from senior-stream teacher to contest organizer in the first place.</p><p>Aside from organizing contests for my club, I also recently started testing some contests on DMOJ, namely the “Yet Another Contest” series (<a href="https://dmoj.ca/contest/yac1">YAC1</a>, <a href="https://dmoj.ca/contest/yac2">YAC2</a>, <a href="https://dmoj.ca/contest/yac3">YAC3</a>). I find some of the problems quite interesting, so I’ll likely continue to be a tester as long as I have the time (I prefer testing over doing the contest itself because I no longer want to be bothered with the stress that comes with competing seriously).</p><p>I’ll also still be writing the CCC next year, as there is no reason not to - according to most sources, there is no penalty for a poor contest performance (i.e. the participation itself can only be helpful) in terms of university applications.</p><h2 id="why-am-i-retiring"><span class="mr-2">Why Am I Retiring?</span><a href="#why-am-i-retiring" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>There are many reasons why I’m choosing to “retire” from serious competitive programming training. Below are some of them:</p><ul><li>As I mentioned, I feel like my skill level is plateauing despite my training, which means I would have to invest an unreasonable amount of time and effort to improve significantly. Without noticing improvement, training feels very tedious. There’s also the fact that only a small fraction of training (especially as one progresses through the breadth of topics) will be directly helpful during the contest, which makes training feel unrewarding.<li>I’m skeptical of how useful competitive programming is in the real world.<ul><li>Some would argue that it helps you with technical interviews (and I don’t doubt that), but I don’t think it’s necessary to spend hundreds of hours doing something that indirectly prepares me. There are still some differences between interview questions and competitive programming tasks, so if I were solely aiming to practice for interviews, I would just grind LeetCode instead.<li>In terms of job search (aka getting you an interview in the first place), I guess I just haven’t seen enough evidence for competitive programming being effective for getting interviews. I know that Google Code Jam finalists get to interview at Google, but I don’t think anyone could reasonably debate that getting an interview normally is harder than becoming one of the top 20 competitive programmers in the world.</ul><li>Next year, I’ll be taking on the responsibility of being a co-director of MasseyHacks, so it might be unfeasible to balance school work, contest organizing, Math contests, and responsibilities as a co-director while also training seriously for programming contests.<li>Frankly, qualifying for CCO in grade 12 isn’t as valuable as qualifying in grade 11 in terms of university applications, since you don’t get the CCC results before you apply for scholarships. There’s a misconception that qualifying for CCO guarantees admission to a certain university, but this is simply not true - I know someone who was rejected (not even deferred) despite making it to CCO in their final year.<ul><li>Though I understand that CCO qualification and strengthening university applications are not the be-all and end-all of doing competitive programming, they were certainly strong incentives.<li>Honestly, even if I trained for CCC starting now, I don’t think I have a favourable probability of qualifying for CCO. The CCC happens only once every year. If CCC 2022 repeats itself next year after I train another couple of months for it, I would, once again, have almost nothing to show for all my effort. Objectively, taking this risk is not the smartest thing to do.</ul></ul><p>In summary, I don’t want to spend my time and effort on something that is perhaps not very meaningful to me anymore. I simply don’t see a strong incentive for me to continue training.</p><h2 id="do-i-regret-doing-competitive-programming"><span class="mr-2">Do I Regret Doing Competitive Programming?</span><a href="#do-i-regret-doing-competitive-programming" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Not at all. I want to make it clear that I’m not saying it’s a bad idea to invest effort into competitive programming. Rather, I think it’s a bad idea to overinvest effort in something one no longer finds meaningful.</p><p>Competitive programming has taught me many things, and I’m very grateful for how it has impacted me. I’ll be brief here since I plan to write about these things in detail in a future post.</p><ul><li>Competitive programming gave me something to focus on and helped me become a more productive person.<li>Competitive programming gave me confidence in my problem-solving abilities and is entirely responsible for my understanding of many algorithms and data structures.<li>Training for programming contests forced me to time-manage and handle stress as I balanced it with other responsibilities in my life.<li>The continuous cycle of learning, practicing, and competing has made me a more efficient learner and helped me understand the learning strategies that were most effective for me.<li>My successful contests gave me a taste of how rewarding hard work and dedication can be.<li>My unsuccessful contests taught me how to manage discouragement after a poor performance.</ul><p>… and so on.</p><p>In the end, I believe my pursuit was very worthwhile.</p><h2 id="closing-thoughts"><span class="mr-2">Closing Thoughts</span><a href="#closing-thoughts" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Despite the relatively short duration of my journey, it was full of irreplaceable experiences and meaningful transformation. Even though I now realize that developing my competitive programming prowess is no longer the most meaningful goal, it (at least) served as an important transition between my purposeless self and the person I am now, while teaching me many invaluable lessons along the way.</p><p>I would like to express my sincere appreciation to everyone who inspired, encouraged, or assisted me along the way. I’m sure it would have been much more lonely and frustrating without you all.</p><p>To my fellow competitive programmers, I wish you a fruitful journey.</p></div><div class="post-tail-wrapper text-muted"><div class="post-meta mb-3"> <i class="far fa-folder-open fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href='/categories/personal-reflection/'>Personal Reflection</a></div><div class="post-tags"> <i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href="/tags/competitive-programming/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >competitive-programming</a></div><div class="post-tail-bottom d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mt-3 pt-5 pb-2"><div class="license-wrapper"> This post is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> CC BY 4.0 </a> by the author.</div><div class="share-wrapper"> <span class="share-label text-muted mr-1">Share</span> <span class="share-icons"> <a href="" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label=""> <i class="fa-fw "></i> </a> <i id="copy-link" class="fa-fw fas fa-link small" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Copy link" data-title-succeed="Link copied successfully!"> </i> </span></div></div></div></div></div><div id="panel-wrapper" class="col-xl-3 pl-2 text-muted"><div class="access"><div id="access-lastmod" class="post"><div class="panel-heading">Recently Updated</div><ul class="post-content pl-0 pb-1 ml-1 mt-2"><li><a href="/posts/My-Competitive-Programming-Journey/">My Competitive Programming Journey</a><li><a href="/posts/Problem-Analysis-0/">Introduction to the Problem Analysis Series</a><li><a href="/posts/Problem-Analysis-3/">Problem Analysis 3</a><li><a href="/posts/Problem-Analysis-4/">Problem Analysis 4</a><li><a href="/posts/Problem-Analysis-5/">Problem Analysis 5</a></ul></div><div id="access-tags"><div class="panel-heading">Trending Tags</div><div class="d-flex flex-wrap mt-3 mb-1 mr-3"> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/competitive-programming/">competitive-programming</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/problem-analysis-series/">problem-analysis-series</a></div></div></div><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/afeld/bootstrap-toc@1.0.1/dist/bootstrap-toc.min.js"></script><div id="toc-wrapper" class="pl-0 pr-4 mb-5"><div class="panel-heading pl-3 pt-2 mb-2">Contents</div><nav id="toc" data-toggle="toc"></nav></div></div></div><div class="row"><div id="tail-wrapper" class="col-12 col-lg-11 col-xl-9 pl-3 pr-3 pr-xl-4"><div id="related-posts" class="mt-5 mb-2 mb-sm-4"><h3 class="pt-2 mt-1 mb-4 ml-1" data-toc-skip>Further Reading</h3><div class="card-deck mb-4"><div class="card"> <a href="/posts/Problem-Analysis-0/"><div class="card-body"> <em class="small" data-ts="1636718400" data-df="ll" > Nov 12, 2021 </em><h3 class="pt-0 mt-1 mb-3" data-toc-skip>Introduction to the Problem Analysis Series</h3><div class="text-muted small"><p> Note From the Future This series of six blog posts was originally a submission to the EWC4U course.
